## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your machine.

- Node.js: [Download](https://nodejs.org/)
- npm: Automatically installed with Node.js
- yarn (optional): [Install yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) if you prefer using yarn over npm.
